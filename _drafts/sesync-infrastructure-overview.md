This is the first in a series of posts describing the various components that make up the core of our IT infrastructure. Please note, that we're always adding new services and tinkering with systems as new research needs arise and as new technologies emerge. This first post should give you an idea of the types of problems and the community we see ourselves serving. 

## Motivation

While we are administratively a center within the College of Math and Natural Sciences at UMD we're a little different from a traditional on-campus unit in a number of ways.

* We're located appromimately 30 miles from College Park so we aren't able to utilize many of the physical plant services available on campus.
* We service a community that is mostly external to SESYNC.
* We had the advantage of being a greenfield project. Prior to our funding in 2011, we didn't exist, there was no existing administrative or IT infrastructure that constrained us.
* We had the disadvantage of being a greenfield project. There was no exising IT infrastructure or business office workflows we could leverage.

## Who we Serve

* Working group, workshop, and short course participants.

 This community consists of groups of individuals that may be together for the two-year duration of a project, or may be invited for a one time meeting with no ongoing commitment. Their needs consist of on-site meeting support as well as varying levels of access to collaboration software for communication and document editing. More data-intensive groups will often need access to larger computational resources, database access, and access to someone who can assist them in using more advanced resources.

* SESYNC Postdocs and their collaborators/mentors.

 Postdocs reside onsite in SESYNC's offices in Annapolis, MD for a term lasting two years. 

* Internal administrative and support for front-office operations.
